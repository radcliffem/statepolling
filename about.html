<h3>How averages are calculated</h3>

To calculate the average in a given state on a particular day, all polls whose start date is within 30 days of the indicated day are averaged. The averaging is done by summing the Clinton value and Trump value for each poll, and averaging the difference (rather than first taking the difference and then the average).<br><br>

If no polling has occurred in a state in the preceding 30 days, earlier polls will be used. However, the polls will be given a lower weight the older they are, and a higher weight will be given to the "default" of a state. A state's default value is taken to be the average of the actual voting differential of the 2004, 2008, and 2012 elections.<br><br>

A state is shaded according to the strength of its average. Darker states show wider margins than lighter states.
